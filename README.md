# 👋 Hi, I’m Travis Ashcraft

🎮 **Game Developer | XR Innovator | Backend Engineer | Creative Technologist**

I’m a multi-disciplinary creator with a passion for building immersive experiences, smart backend systems, and transformative tools for education and entertainment. By day, I lead production tech efforts at **Texas State Technical College (TSTC)**. By night, I’m designing dark multiplayer survival games, coding modular Unreal plugins, and composing cinematic synth tracks.
